# Play with Collatz Sequence

A program to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.

## 📝 Description

This program calculates the Collatz sequence for a given number. The sequence is defined as follows:

1.  Start with any positive integer `n`.
2.  If `n` is even, the next number is `n / 2`.
3.  If `n` is odd, the next number is `n * 3 + 1`.
4.  Repeat the process until the number becomes `1`.

The program will output the entire sequence, including the starting number and the final `1`, as a comma-separated list.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Input:

  * A single integer `n`.

### Output:

  * A string of comma-separated numbers representing the Collatz sequence if `n` is a positive integer.
  * "NoProceed" if `n` is zero or a negative number.

### Rules:

1.  The input number **n** must be a **positive integer** (greater than 0).
2.  If the input is zero or negative, the program should output the message **"NoProceed"**.
3.  The sequence must be generated by repeatedly applying the even/odd rules until the value `1` is reached.

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1 (n = 6)

**Input:**

```
6
```

**Output:**

```
6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
```

**Explanation:**

  * 6 (even) -\> 6/2 = 3
  * 3 (odd) -\> 3\*3+1 = 10
  * 10 (even) -\> 10/2 = 5
  * ...and so on, until 1.

### Example 2 (n = 5)

**Input:**

```
5
```

**Output:**

```
5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
```

**Explanation:**

  * 5 (odd) -\> 5\*3+1 = 16
  * 16 (even) -\> 16/2 = 8
  * ...and so on, until 1.

### Example 3 (n = 1)

**Input:**

```
1
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

**Explanation:** The sequence starts and ends at 1.

### Example 4 (n = 0)

**Input:**

```
0
```

**Output:**

```
NoProceed
```

**Explanation:** The input is 0, which is not a positive integer.

### Example 5 (n = -1)

**Input:**

```
-1
```

**Output:**

```
NoProceed
```

**Explanation:** The input is a negative number, which is outside the valid range.
